# 80 Days to Stay

> *"A wager against time, a race against bureaucracy, and an adventure in data for good."*

## The Challenge

Like Phileas Fogg's famous 80-day race around the world, we're on a mission against the clock. But instead of circumnavigating the globe, we're building a lifeline for international students and skilled workers facing visa deadlines.

**The stakes?** H1B and OPT visa holders have limited time to find sponsorship before they must leave the country they've come to call home. Traditional job platforms don't show which companies can actually sponsor visas. Time is running out.

**The solution?** A database connecting visa holders with funded startups capable of sponsorship—companies that have the resources but remain invisible to those who need them most.

## The Mission

Build a searchable platform that reveals:
- **Funded startups** ($5M+) with resources to sponsor
- **Real-time job openings** at these companies  
- **Direct founder contacts** to bypass HR gatekeepers
- **Sponsorship likelihood scores** based on funding, growth, and hiring patterns

All using **free, public SEC data** and open-source tools.

## The Timeline

- **Week 1:** MVP with 300+ companies (Boston, SF, NYC biotech)
- **Week 4:** 500+ companies, 10+ active users, validation metrics
- **Week 11:** Proof of concept—at least one H1B transfer secured
- **Day 80:** Success stories, growth metrics, sustainable model

## Why This Matters

Every year, talented professionals—researchers, engineers, healthcare workers—face deportation not because they lack skills, but because they lack information. We're turning SEC filings into second chances.

## The Technology

**Data Pipeline:** Python + SEC EDGAR API (free)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL on Supabase (free tier)  
**Backend:** FastAPI on Railway (free tier)  
**Frontend:** React + Tailwind on Vercel (free tier)  
**Budget:** ~$0/month (vs $99/month for commercial data)

## Join the Adventure

We need volunteers with:
- **Data skills** - Python, web scraping, API integration
- **Engineering skills** - FastAPI, React, database design
- **Research skills** - Company validation, contact enrichment
- **Community skills** - Testing, documentation, user feedback

**No experience required—just commitment.** This is a learn-by-doing project where you'll gain real-world data engineering and full-stack development experience while helping people stay with their families, continue their research, and pursue their dreams.

## The Wager

**Can we build a platform that saves at least one person's visa status in 80 days?**

Unlike Phileas Fogg, we won't travel the world—we'll bring the world of opportunity to those racing against time.
